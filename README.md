# demand-response-api

This lightweight Flask API is a minimalist tool for electric utilities, Independent System Operators, and aggregators to manage demand response notifications. Demand response notification is still predominantly done through email and text, and this simple API streamlines device automations, e.g. through Home Assistant, without having to resort to workarounds for parsing event notifications in less amenable formats.
